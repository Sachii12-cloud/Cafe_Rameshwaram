        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The Man Who Inspired Many</p>
        <br>
        <p>“You have to dream before your dreams can come true.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action”</p>
        <br>
        <p>- Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

    <div class="container5">
        <p>It was dream of founders to launch “The Rameshwaram Café” as a premium pure vegetarian South Indian Chain of Quick Service Restaurant. That dream transformed and came true during 2021 with successful launch of two outlets in Bengaluru. The name ‘Rameshwaram’ was chosen by founders to pay tribute to Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam as it was his birthplace. It holds true to its value of authenticity and the expansive flavours of South India. In the chaotic cacophony of extrovert leaders, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam led the nation with his patience, dedication, and charming old-school ways. At Rameshwaram, we look up to him in every form and draw inspiration from the way he lived — holding ground in grandeur.</p>
